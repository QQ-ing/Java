# Controller直接调用Repository的疑问

平时写MVC框架项目时，经常会遇到大量这样的代码：

```Java
@Service
public class UserService {
  @Autowired UserRepository repository;
  
  public List<User> findAll(){
    return repository.findAll();
  }
  
  puhblic User findById(long id) {
    return repository.findById(id);
  }
  
  public User findByName(String name) {
    return repository.findByName(name);
  }
  
  ...
}
```

这里的service仅仅只是对dao操作进行了代理，并没有自己本身的逻辑操作。对于大量的简单查询而已，就需要我们写大量的service去“代理”respository，显得十分臃肿，似乎没有不要。

那么，对于简单的查询而已，我们是否可以省去这层“代理”，直接在controller中调用respository的方法呢？


In theory: within the context of the MVC architectural pattern, there is no clear distinction between a data access layer (DAO) and a service layer. The Service layer and the DAO layer could both be seen as the "Model" in MVC. A Service layer may well implement business logic, complex validations, etc. - yet it is still a layer for accessing your data! As long as you maintain a clean separation of concerns between your Model, View and Controller objects, it would be correct to access the DAO layer from a Controller object.

In practice: I have seen both scenarios. If you have a small application with a simple data model, it would make sense to use the DAO layer directly from Controllers. However, as business logic gets complicated, or if your model is shared by more than one application, it would make more sense to factor out Business Delegates and DAOs in order to re-use components, minimize impact when changes are made, increased flexibility between components, etc. This would be dictated by the technical architecture of the system in question.
